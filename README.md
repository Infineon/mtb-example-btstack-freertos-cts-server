# Bluetooth&reg; LE CTS server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Central - GATT server with Current Time Service ([CTS](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/current-time-service-1-1)) using  PSOC&trade; 6 MCU, AIROC&trade;  CYW20829, and ModusToolbox&trade; environment.

In this code example, the kit scans for **CTS Client**, and after connection with a CTS-based client, sends notifications with Current Time characteristic values derived from the local date and time. The time and date sent as notification are printed on the serial terminal.

This code example along with [Bluetooth&reg; LE CTS Client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-cts-client) are low-power-enabled for AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE and can be used to measure the current consumption by PSOC&trade; 6 (not optimized for power) and CYW43XXX when using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE feature. See [AN227910: Low-power system design with CYW43012 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-AN227910_Low-power_system_design_with_AIROC_CYW43012_Wi-Fi_%26_Bluetooth_combo_chip_and_PSoC_6_MCU-ApplicationNotes-v03_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7cdc391c017d0d39b66166f3) to learn about Bluetooth&reg; power optimization techniques and power measurement using this CE.

## Operation

If using a PSOC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSOC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to initialize the required components. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window as shown in **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output when the device is programmed with the CE**
   
   ![](images/terminal_output1.png)

5. Use another supported PSOC&trade; 6 kit and program it with the [Bluetooth&reg; LE CTS Client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-cts-client) code example.

6. Once both the kits are powered, press the user button (SW2) on the client device to start the advertisement and then press button (SW2) on the server to start the scanning. The application trace messages appear in the terminal window, as shown in Figure 2.

   **Figure 2. Terminal output - Scanning and connecting**

   ![](images/terminal_output2.png)

7. After establishing the connection between the client and server, press the button (SW2) on the client to enable notifications. The server device will start sending notifications with the Current Time characteristic values derived from the device real-time clock. The date and time sent as notification are printed on the serial terminal.

   **Figure 3. Terminal output - Sending notification**

   ![](images/terminal_output3.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

>**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

The [Bluetooth&reg; LE CTS server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-cts-server) code example configures the device as a Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Central - GATT server device. Use this application with the [Bluetooth&reg; CTS Client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-cts-client), which is a GAP Peripheral - GATT client device.

This code example showcases Current Time Service-based time profile. In this CE, the mandatory Current time characteristic with read and notify properties are implemented. The time profile defines two roles: Time server (GATT server) and Time client (GATT client).

**Figure 4. Time profile role and service relationships**

![](images/time_profile_roles.png)

The entry point of the application is `int main()`, which initializes the BSP and Bluetooth&reg; stack. The application-level initializations like RTC and GATT database initialization are handled by the `ble_app_init()` function. This function starts scanning for the peripheral device by registering a callback using `wiced_bt_ble_scan()`.

This application will specifically scan for advertisement with the Peripheral device name `CTS Client` and establish a LE GATT connection. All the GATT events are handled in `ble_app_gatt_event_handler()`. During Read or Notify GATT operations, the fields of the Current Time characteristic are set to values derived from the local date and time and sent as GATT Read response or as notification to the peripheral device. The same data is printed on the serial terminal.

The RTC provides time and date information – second, minute, hour, day of the week, date, month, and year using the RTC driver API. The time and date information are updated every second with automatic leap year compensation performed by the RTC hardware block. The RTC initialization is also done in `ble_app_init()`.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and re-targeting of the standard I/O to the UART port is done using the retarget-io library.


### Power measurement: Implementation of low power for AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE

This examples enables you to measure power in three different AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE states: Standby, Scanning, and Connected. Do the following to enter each state and measure the power consumption for different kits.

1. **Standby state:** After programming the device, AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE is initialized and stays in standby state. On the terminal, check for the message 'Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization successful'; you can measure power for standby state.

2. **Scanning state:** Press the user button (SW2) on your kit to start scanning. Note that the kit with CTS client CE must be advertising when scanning is started. When it discovers the peer device, it sends a connection request. A high duty scan will be performed initially for 30 seconds. Then the device switches to low duty scanning without timeout. High duty scanning of 30 seconds is chosen for faster discovery. If required, this configuration can be changed using the 'bt-configurator' tool that comes with ModusToolbox&trade; installation.

3. **Connected state:** Once the scanner finds the advertiser, a connection is established. The terminal displays the message 'Connected : BDA xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'.


### Current measuring points for kits


#### **CY8CKIT-062S2-43012, CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01, CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01 and CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W**

**For PSOC&trade; 6 MCU:**

1. Remove J25 to eliminate leakage currents across potentiometer R1.

2. Measure the current at J15 across VTARG and P6_VDD.

**For CYW43xxx:**

- Measure the current at VBAT across VBAT and VCC_VBAT at J8.


#### **CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2**

**For PSOC&trade; 6 MCU:**

1. Remove J21 to eliminate leakage currents across potentiometer R1.

2. Measure the current at J15 across VTARG and P6_VDD.

**For CYW4373E:**

2. Connect an ammeter between VTARG (J2.32) and P6_VDD (J2.24).

3. Remove R24 at the back of the board, below J1.9, to eliminate the leakage current.

   R24 is the pull-up resistor attached to the WL_HOST_WAKE pin P0_4, which leaks approximately 330 µA because P0_4 is driven LOW when there is no network activity. In total, the PSOC&trade; 6 MCU deep sleep current is approximately 350 µA.

**For CYW4343W:**

1. Measure the current at VBAT1 and VBAT2 supplies used for powering CYW4343W. VBAT1 and VABT2 are shorted to each other.
2. Remove R87 on the back of the board towards the right and above J2.33.
3. Connect an ammeter between the pads of R87 to measure the current.


#### **CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT**

**For PSOC&trade; 6 MCU:**

1. Measure the current  by connecting an ammeter to the PWR MON jumper J8.

**For CYW4343W:**

1. Measure the current at WL_VBAT (used for powering CYW4343W) by removing L3 along the right edge of the board close to the CYW4343W module, and connecting an ammeter between the pads of L3.


#### **CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W**

**For PSOC&trade; 6 MCU:**

1. Measure the current by removing R59 and connecting an ammeter across VTARG (J2.32) and P6_VDD (J2.31).

**For CYW4343W:**

1. Measure the current by removing R55 and connecting an ammeter between the resistor pads (VCC_3V6 and VBAT_WL).

Table 1 captures the current numbers measured using this CE for two BSPs. The kits have different connectivity devices - CYW43012 and CYW43438. The measurement is not performed in a radio isolated environment. The current consumption by the PSOC&trade; 6 device is also measured; it was identical across all Bluetooth&reg; states. The following are the average current values:

- For PSOC&trade; 6 device in CY8CKIT-062S2-43012: 27 µA

- For PSOC&trade; 6 device in CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01: 620 µA

- For PSOC&trade; 6 device in CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2: 23 µA

### Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder. By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory.

   It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly. To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP refer to the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration.

   For detailed information on how to use the Device Configurator, see the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_Guide_4-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab297631cb).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

  > **Note:** Unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application.

   For detailed information on how to use the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator, see the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Bluetooth_Configurator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99aaf5b231be).

   > **Note:** For PSOC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE-based BSPs(CY8CKIT-062-BLE, CY8CPROTO-063-BLE, CYBLE-416045-EVAL) with support for AIROC&trade; BTSTACK, if you want to use the bt-configurator tool, select the *AIROC&trade; BTSTACK with Bluetooth&reg; LE only (CYW20829, PSOC&trade; 6 with CYW43xxx Connectivity device)* option from the dropdown to select the device. Do not use the *PSOC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE Legacy Stack (PSOC&trade; 6-BLE)* option because it is not compatible with AIROC&trade; BTSTACK.
